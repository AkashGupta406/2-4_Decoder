# Abstract
In this paper, I have discussed the designing as well as the implementation of a 2:4 Decoder using the CMOS logic family. Its implementation will be done using the 28nm Synopsis Custom Design Platform. A decoder circuit changes a code into a set of signals. It is called decoder because it does the reverse of encoding. We can verify output using  the waveforms obtained from the circuit. Here we are using the CMOS technology because it has very low static power generation, high density of logicfunctions on chip, small size and good noise immunity.

# Introduction
The fundamental digital module is the decoder which decodes the coded input which is generally used in the all types of memory devices. Most common decoder circuit is an n input to 2^n output binary decoder. In the conventional design the CMOS technology is used to design the logic of any application
